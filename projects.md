## Featured Projects

### 🚀 Kafka-TOON Benchmark Tool

**A high-performance benchmarking framework for message encoding formats**

- Compares TOON (binary format) vs JSON serialization with gzip compression variants
- Measures end-to-end latency, decode time, and payload size
- Interactive web-based viewer with real-time analytics and charts using Plotly.js
- Built with TypeScript, Node.js, Kafka, and Docker

**Key Metrics:**
- TOON encoding is **58% faster** than JSON for E2E latency
- Comprehensive analysis of encoding/decoding performance
- Real-world scenario testing with configurable message rates

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Apache Kafka, Docker, Plotly.js
